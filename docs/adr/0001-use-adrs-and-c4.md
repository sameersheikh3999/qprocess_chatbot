# 0001 â€” Use ADRs and C4 Diagrams
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-08-11

## Context
Requirements were unclear; we need durable, lightweight documentation and diagrams as code.

## Decision
Adopt Architecture Decision Records and C4 views (as Mermaid).

## Consequences
- Decisions recorded in `docs/adr/`.
- Diagrams in `docs/diagrams/` kept versioned alongside code.
